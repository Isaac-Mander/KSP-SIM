# KSP-SIM
A repo for my personal Kerbal Space Program cockpit project

Included is the code, 3d files, and my FreeCAD (or other files) which contain panometric versions of each 3d model.

I've also added a utility I made to speed up making laser cutting files by drawing and generating panels using python.

Currently I have only added in my first "main panel", but I will add in others as I make them / can be bothered to collect all the files and port them over.
